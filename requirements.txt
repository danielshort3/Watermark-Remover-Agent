# Additional packages required for LangGraph support.  The ``langgraph`` package
# provides the core graph abstractions while ``langgraph-cli`` installs the
# ``langgraph`` command line interface used to launch the local API server.  The
# ``[inmem]`` extra is included so that the CLI can run with the built‑in
# in‑memory runtime, which is required for local development.  Without this
# extra, you may encounter missing dependency errors when starting the
# development server.
langgraph>=0.2.0
langgraph-cli[inmem]>=0.2.0

# PDF parsing library for order of worship processing
