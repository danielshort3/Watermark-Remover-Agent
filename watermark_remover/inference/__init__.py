"""
Inference subpackage exposing model definitions and helper utilities.

This package currently contains the UNet and VDSR model
implementations along with functions to load model checkpoints and
convert between PIL images and tensors.  Additional inference helpers
should be added here to keep the agent tools small and focused.
