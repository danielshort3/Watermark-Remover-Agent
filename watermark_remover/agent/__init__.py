"""Agent subpackage for the Watermark Remover project.

This subpackage contains tools, agent helpers and graph definitions for
orchestrating the watermark removal pipeline.  In addition to the
LangChain-based agent helpers defined elsewhere in the repository, this
package now includes a LangGraph-based pipeline graph that can be
executed via the LangGraph server.  See
``watermark_remover.agent.multi_agent_graph`` for details.
