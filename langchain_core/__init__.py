"""Stub package for ``langchain_core``.

This lightweight package exposes minimal functionality required by the
watermark removal agent.  Only the ``messages`` and ``runnables``
submodules are provided, each implemented as a simple stub.  Importing
other modules from ``langchain_core`` will raise an ImportError.
